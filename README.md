Evaluating and Defining Bacterial Antimicrobial Resistance Genes
In this repository are multiple scripts that where used to complete this project
the first to do is run the runrgi.py and runabricate.sh

after that, the rgi results are being modified by the cardtosummaryonallfiles.py script.
this script takes all the outfiles from the rgi tool and makes a single file with all the results.

after that the abricate_db.py file is used to label the various databases within the abricate result files
